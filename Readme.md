## Difficulties Encountered

Throughout the exercise, we faced several challenges and difficulties that required problem-solving and adaptation.
The following are the main difficulties we encountered:

1. **Decision-making**: It was challenging to determine which parts of the project to prioritize
 and which elements to include or exclude.

2. **Transition to 3D**: This project marked the first time our developers and designers
 worked on a complete 3D game, which presented a learning curve and
 required additional efforts to master the new dimension.

3. **Team coordination**: As a team of five people, it was sometimes difficult to coordinate
 and find suitable meeting times that accommodated everyone's availability.

## Feedback, Implementation, and Playtesting

Throughout the development process, we actively sought feedback,
made necessary implementations, and conducted playtests to improve the game.
The following points highlight the key feedback received and the corresponding actions taken:

1. **Level design**: We received feedback regarding the positioning of Kones in the level.
We iterated on this aspect, making several adjustments and even
adding an extra Kones to enhance the gameplay experience.

2. **Tutorial**: Based on feedback, we recognized the need for a tutorial in the game.
We implemented a tutorial section to provide players with instructions and guidance.

3. **Leaderboard**: We incorporated a leaderboard feature that allows
multiple scores to be saved and displayed.

4. **Dash mechanics**: Feedback prompted us to make adjustments to the dash time and effects.
We iteratively refined this aspect through extensive playtesting until achieving a final satisfactory form.
